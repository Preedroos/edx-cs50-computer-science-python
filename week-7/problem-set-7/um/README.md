# "Um" Counter

## Overview

This Python script counts the occurrences of the word "um" in a given text. It uses regular expressions for matching and can handle variations in capitalization.

## Features

- **User Input**: Prompts the user to input a line of text.
- **Counting Occurrences**: Counts how many times the word "um" appears in the text, treating it as a whole word (not as part of other words).
- **Case Insensitivity**: The count is case-insensitive, meaning "Um", "UM", and "uM" are all recognized as valid occurrences.

## How to Use

1. Run the script in your Python environment:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

2. When prompted, enter a line of text, for example:

   ```
   Text: Um, um... I think um is a common filler word.
   ```

3. The script will print the number of times "um" appears in the text:

### Example

```bash
Text: Um, um... I think um is a common filler word.
3
```
