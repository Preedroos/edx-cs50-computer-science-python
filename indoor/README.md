### In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged.

<br />

* You might want to run this program, so there's an example of how to do so below:

```
$ python indoor.py
```

* Then enter some content you wish to parse to lower case.
