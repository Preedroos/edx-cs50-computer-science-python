# Vowel Remover Program

## Overview

This Python script takes a user input and removes all vowels from the input string, returning the shortened version of the word.

## Features

- **Vowel Removal**: The script eliminates all vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) from a word or sentence, regardless of case (e.g., "A" and "a" are both removed).
- **User Input**: The user inputs a word or sentence, and the program outputs the string with vowels removed.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a word or sentence when prompted.
3. The script will return the input without vowels.

### Example

```
Input: Hello, World!
Output: Hll, Wrld!
```
