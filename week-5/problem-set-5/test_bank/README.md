# Greeting Value Calculator

## Overview

This Python script calculates the monetary value of a greeting based on specific rules. It assigns different values depending on how the greeting begins.

## Features

- **Greeting Evaluation**: The program evaluates the input greeting and assigns a value based on the following criteria:
  - If the greeting starts with "hello", the value is **$0**.
  - If the greeting starts with the letter "h" (but not "hello"), the value is **$20**.
  - For all other greetings, the value is **$100**.
- **User Input**: The user inputs a greeting, and the program outputs its corresponding value.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a greeting when prompted.
3. The script will return the assigned value based on the greeting.

### Example

```
Greeting: Hello, everyone!
$0

Greeting: Hi there!
$20

Greeting: Good morning!
$100
```
