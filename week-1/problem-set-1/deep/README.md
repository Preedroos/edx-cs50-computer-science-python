### In deep.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. Otherwise output No.

<br />

* You might want to run this program, so there's an example of how to do so below:

```
$ python deep.py
```

<br />
