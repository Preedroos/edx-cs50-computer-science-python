### In a file called extensions.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file’s media type if the file’s name ends, case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:
```
.gif
.jpg
.jpeg
.png
.pdf
.txt
.zip
```

<br />

* You might want to run this program, so there's an example of how to do so below:

```
$ python extensions.py
```

<br />

For more details, see the [PROBLEM SET 1 - EXTENSIONS](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/extensions/) reference.
