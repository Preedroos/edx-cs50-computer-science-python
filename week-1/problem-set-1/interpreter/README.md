### In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:
```
x is an integer
y is +, -, *, or /
z is an integer
```
For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

<br />

* You might want to run this program, so there's an example of how to do so below:

```
$ python interpreter.py
```
