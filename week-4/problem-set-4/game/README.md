# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

This Python script is a simple number guessing game. The user sets a difficulty level, and the program generates a random number between 1 and that level. The user then tries to guess the number, and the script provides feedback whether the guess is too low or too high until the correct number is guessed.

## Features

- **Customizable Difficulty**: The user selects a difficulty level, which defines the range of the random number.
- **Interactive Feedback**: After each guess, the program tells the user if the guess is too small or too large.
- **Error Handling**: The script ensures valid numeric inputs for both the level and guesses.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a difficulty level (a positive integer).
3. Keep guessing the number until you find the correct one, with the script guiding you through each attempt.

### Example

```
Level: 10
Guess: 5
Too small!
Guess: 8
Too large!
Guess: 7
Just right!
```
