# Math Quiz Game

## Overview

This Python script generates a math quiz where users solve 10 addition problems based on their chosen difficulty level. Each problem allows up to 3 attempts, and the score is displayed at the end.

## Features

- **Difficulty Levels**: The user selects a level (1, 2, or 3), which determines the range of numbers used in the problems:
  - Level 1: Numbers between 0-9
  - Level 2: Numbers between 10-99
  - Level 3: Numbers between 100-999
- **Multiple Attempts**: For each problem, the user has 3 attempts to provide the correct answer.
- **Score Tracking**: The user's score is based on how many problems are answered correctly.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Choose a difficulty level (1, 2, or 3).
3. Answer the 10 generated math problems, with up to 3 attempts per problem.
4. At the end, the script will display your score.

### Example

12 + 34 = 46
