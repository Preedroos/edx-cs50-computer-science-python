### In a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the userâ€™s input will indeed be in camel case.

<br />

* You might want to run this program, so there's an example of how to do so below:

```
$ python camel.py
```

<br />
