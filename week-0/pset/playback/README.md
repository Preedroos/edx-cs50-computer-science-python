### In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

<br />

* You might want to run this program, so there's an example of how to do so below:

```
$ python playback.py
```

* Then enter some content you wish to slow down.
