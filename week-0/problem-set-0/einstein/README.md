### In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.

<br />

* You might want to run this program, so there's an example of how to do so below:

```
$ python einstein.py
```

* Then enter mass in integer to calculate its energy.
