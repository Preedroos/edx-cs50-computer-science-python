### In a file called faces.py, implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to 🙂 (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any :( converted to 🙁 (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text should be returned unchanged.

<br />

* You might want to run this program, so there's an example of how to do so below:

```
$ python faces.py
```

* Then enter any of those two emoticons to convert to emojis.

<br />
