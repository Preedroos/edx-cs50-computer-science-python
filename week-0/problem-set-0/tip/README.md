### In the United States, it’s customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your meal’s cost. Not to worry, though, we’ve written a tip calculator for you, below!

<br />

* You might want to run this program, so there's an example of how to do so below:

```
$ python tip.py
```

* Then enter the meal price.

```
How much was the meal? $50.00
```

* And the tip percentage.

```
What percentage would you like to tip? 15%
```

* Finally, you should see the recommended tip.
